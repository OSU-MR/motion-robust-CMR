# Non-Decimated_Wavelets
This Matlab software computes the multidimensional, non-decimated wavelet transform.  Codes are included for 1-4 dimensional wavelet transforms.  The codes assume periodic boundary conditions and use  Daubechies wavelets.  The wavelet transforms are computed using fast convolution, and the wavelet filters are stored for efficient computation when multiple wavelet decomposition and reconstruction operations are being preformed (such as in an iterative algorithm).
